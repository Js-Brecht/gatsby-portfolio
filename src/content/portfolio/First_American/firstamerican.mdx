<p class="small space-me right blog-text">The dashboard houses a lot of logic for the contractors. The design allows them to navigate quickly to different parts of the portal - from accepting new contracts to filing invoices, the idea was to help keep contractors focused in the field and less on their devices.</p>

<p class="small space-me right blog-text">The appointment view allows contractors to quickly communicate with customers and update the status of their job/work order. The design utilizes a dynamic side panel to pull in content based on the contractors choices. The flow below demonstrates 2 paths a contractor might take while in the field.</p>

<img class="large" src={fa5} />

<p class="small space-me right blog-text">The left path allows the contractor to update their arrival status or reschedule an appointment if needed. The right path illustrates a completed work order path or if there is an issue and the contractor needs another contractor with a specialized skillset.</p>

<p class="small space-me right blog-text">The Work Orders section of the site utilizes the same dynamic side panels.</p>

<img class="large" src={fa7} />

<p class="small space-me right blog-text">The invoicing section utilizes the dynamic form fields, using dynamic content allows us to serve the user better without having to load extra content that may or may not be used.<br /><button class="page-button"><a href="https://herodigital.invisionapp.com/share/PQP60ESCYME#/screens">Check out the Prototype</a></button></p>
